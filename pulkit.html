    <p><strong>Urbanization</strong> has created a large number of problems for the people. It is not argued that
        urbanization is desirable in itself, but the <em><a
                href="https://www.google.co.in/search?ei=ecvEXqK4E7TCz7sP8PO6sAY&q=haphazard&oq=hapha&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgcIABBGEPkBMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgQIABBHOgUIABCRAjoFCAAQgwE6CQgAEEMQRhD5AToECAAQQ1DAEVizKWD9PGgBcAN4AIABiwOIAfEHkgEHMC40LjAuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXqwAQA&sclient=psy-ab"
                target="_blank"> haphazard</a></em> growth of modern cities and towns has created a very unhealthy
        <em>environment</em>. Urbanization has given rise to overcrowding, slums, inadequate civic amenities. These
        evils are not inherent in urban <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization"
                target="_blank">civilization</a></em>.They could have been avoided if town growth had been
        systematically planned. Urbanization must be so planned that cities may enjoy all the advantages of villages.
        The new towns should be situated amidst rural surroundings so that their dwellers enjoy plenty of fresh air and
        have neat and clean houses. Slums are a disgrace to the com­munity. They are unfit for human <em><a
                href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/habitation" target="_blank">habitation</a></em>. They breed
        all kinds of diseases and epidemics. Urbanization has polluted the <em>environment</em> which is a big problem.
        A great deal can also be done to improve urban <em>environment</em> if the Government and municipal corporations
        spare more funds for civic amenities, construct new houses for the slum-dwellers, plan town expansion on more
        scientific lines and insist on factory-owners providing houses for their workers. <br> Overall, urbanization is
        disadvantages more than its advantages .The government must plan for urban growth and development. It must make
        policies that will enhance <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_land_management"
                target="_blank">sustainable land management</a></em> and minimize ecological degradation. Urbanization
        is a cross-road which governments cannot ignore.</p><br>
